The source-code of "Can Large Language Models Grasp Legal Theories? Enhance Legal Reasoning with Insights from Multi-Agent Collaboration" (EMNLP2024)

**üéâ Our work has been accepted in EMNLP-2024 (findings, long paper).**


## Ethical Consideration 
Our work focuses on exploring algorithms to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs, rather than replacing human judges or being directly used in real-world decision-making applications. 
In practical use, human judges should act as the final safeguard to maintain fairness and mitigate the potential harms related to algorithms. **All resources are for scientific research only**.
